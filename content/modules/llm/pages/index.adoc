== Introduction

We will complete the following tasks:

* Create a workbench and get the tutorial code
* Convert a model from Huggingface to a format that Caikit serving can use.
* Deploy the model by using single-model serving with the Caikit runtime
* Test the model API

== About LLMs

Today, we'll be using Google's https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small[flan-t5-small] because of compatibility, small size, and small requirements (no gpu).
