== Introduction

Welcome!

In this {deliverable}, you'll start with the basics of {productname-short}, and end with some of the newest and most advanced features.

If you've never used {productname-short}, don't worry.  We'll start with a straightforward fraud detection model built with Tensorflow to learn the basics.  Then we'll progress to some new features of {productname-short} that allow it to be a great platform for generative AI and large language models.  This will include distributed training and LLM model serving with CaiKit.

You'll use an example fraud detection model to complete the following tasks:

* Explore a fraud detection model by using Jupyter Notebooks.
* Deploy the model by using {productname-short} single model serving.
* Refine and train the model by using automated pipelines.

Using an LLM Google's https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small[flan-t5-small]  We'll complete the following tasks:

* Wrap the LLM using Caikit for easy serving
* Serve the model using Caikit
